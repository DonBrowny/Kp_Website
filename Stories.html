                <p>Working in KP has been a great opportunity and a magnificent learning journey, both personally and professionally.
                    Is there anything better than working with your friends on a cause you like? I would let you answer that
                    question ;) KP has provided a platform where I can learn, create and test out any passion project that
                    I'm interested in. The team has really top notch folks and interacting with the members is an incredible
                    and easy way to see how bright minds work. I am able to see how operating in KP is helping me see my
                    strengths and weaknesses, and, provides short loops to receive feedback on my blindspots. People keep
                    talking about agile work culture and paradigm shifts these days, though I'm not sure how many organizations
                    truly implement the philosophy of being truly agile. From the little I know, KP is amazingly agile and
                    anyone who is committed to put the work and align to our values, it's gonna be a treat.</p>

                <p>Being a teacher a quote that always has stayed with me is "Experience is the teacher of all things". I strongly
                    believe in this and the past 8 months in KP have been similar. While trying to understand how I could
                    contribute to the project and experimenting with different things I have learnt a lot on the way about
                    myself, about how much of a difference we could make through technology for our vision for children.
                    I also have understood team dynamics with my interactions with diverse individuals. KP is a space where
                    I can be the way I like being that is just open to learning at every point of time.
